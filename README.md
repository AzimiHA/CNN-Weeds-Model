# CNN-Weeds-Model

In this paper we reproduce the results of EfficientNet and MobileNet and compare
them against the results stated in their respective papers. We train the two models
on the Deep Weeds dataset to evaluate their transfer learning potential on a new
classification task, and discuss the results and advantages to each model.
